      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a motivated and passionate Full Stack Developer with strong
        hands-on experience in building scalable and responsive web applications
        using modern technologies. I have a solid foundation in Java and
        JavaScript, with practical expertise in frontend and backend
        development. My technical strengths include designing clean user
        interfaces, developing RESTful APIs, managing databases, and integrating
        full-stack systems. I have worked on multiple real-world projects
        involving React, Spring Boot, MySQL, Oracle, and Firebase, where I
        gained experience in application architecture, CRUD operations,
        authentication, and deployment workflows. Currently, I am pursuing my
        Full Stack Developer Internship at Tap Academy, where I am undergoing
        Campus-to-Corporate training in Core Java, Advanced Java, React.js, and
        SQL. I am actively applying OOP concepts, JDBC, REST APIs, and database
        operations while developing industry-level projects. I am enthusiastic
        about problem-solving, continuous learning, and contributing to
        innovative development teams. My goal is to grow as a professional
        software engineer and deliver impactful digital solutions.

    <!-- WHY HTML -->
    <section
      id="whyhtml"
      style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      <h2>Why HTML?</h2>
      <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. Think of it as the skeleton or the structural blueprint of a webpage.

It isn't a programming language in the sense that it doesn't handle logic (like "if this, then that"); instead, it uses tags to tell a web browser how to display content.

The Anatomy of a Tag
Most HTML elements have an opening tag, content, and a closing tag:<h1>This is a Heading</h1><p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

Why do we use it?
HTML is the "why" behind how we perceive information online. Here are the three main reasons it is essential:

1. Structure and Organization
Without HTML, a browser wouldn’t know the difference between a main title, a sidebar, or a navigation link. It organizes raw text and images into a readable hierarchy.

2. Universal Communication
HTML is a global standard. No matter which browser you use (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) or what device you are on (phone, laptop, fridge), they all speak HTML. 
This ensures that a website created in New York looks and functions basically the same in Tokyo.

3. The "Hook" for Everything Else
HTML acts as the foundation for other web technologies:

CSS (Design): Hooks onto HTML tags to add colors, fonts, and layouts.

JavaScript (Interactivity): Hooks onto HTML to add buttons that click, forms that submit, and animations.

A Simple Comparison
If a webpage were a house:

HTML is the framing, walls, and foundation.

CSS is the paint, wallpaper, and furniture.

JavaScript is the electricity, plumbing, and smart home features.
